The formular is:
{\(The \: Secret \: Key \: = \: Y^s \: modulo \: p\)}

{\(s\)} is your secret.
{\(Y\)} is the public key of the other person. When you are Alice, {\(Y\)} is public key of Bob.
{\(p\)} is the common prime number between Alice and Bob.

So under that circumstances:

<Bob></Bob>
<Alice></Alice>\
<!--- Very ugly, but because of Twine there is no other option !!! -->
<script>
let latex = window.document.querySelector("Bob");
latex.innerText = "\\(Bobs \\: Secret \\: Key \\: is \\: S_{Bob} =\\:" + $ALICE_PUBLICKEY + "^{" + $BOBS_SECRET + "}\\: \\: modulo \\: \\: " + $COMMON_PRIME + "\\)";
latex = window.document.querySelector("Alice");
latex.innerText = "\\(Alice' \\: Secret \\: Key \\: is \\: S_{Alice} =\\:" + $BOBS_PUBLICKEY + "^{" + $ALICE_SECRET + "}\\: \\: modulo \\: \\: " + $COMMON_PRIME + "\\)";

Step 3:
<div class="storyteller">\
Now it's time to exchange your public keys. Even now it does not matter when someone is now your public keys.
</div>

Step 4: 
<div class="storyteller">\
So both of you received the public key of each other. So in the next step, you'll compute the secret key! Never ever share your secret key with someone.\

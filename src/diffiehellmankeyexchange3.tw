The formula of the computation of the public key is:
{\(Your \: Public \: Key \: = \: g^s \: modulo \: p\)}

The Explanation of the formula:
{\(s\)} is your secret. Very important: {\(s \lt p\)}!
{\(g\)} is the common primitive root of your common primenumber {\(p\)}. Very important: {\(g \lt p\)}. 
{\(p\)} is the common prime number between Alice and Bob.

Secret Box (that no one can see)\
<div class="quiz-info">\
The common prime number was set to: $COMMON_PRIME.
The common prime root of modolu your prime was set to: $COMMON_GEN.
Alice secret was: $ALICE_SECRET.
Bobs secret was: $BOBS_SECRET.

Under that circumstances:
<Bob>PLACEHOLDER</Bob>
<Alice>PLACEHOLDER</Alice>\
<!--- Very ugly, but because of Twine there is no other option !!! -->

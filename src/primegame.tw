A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive integer divisors other than 1 and itself.
For example, the first six prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.
There are an infinite number of prime numbers, and they play an important role in mathematics and computer science.
For example, they are used in encryption algorithms to secure communication over the internet.
To check whether a given number is prime, one method is to divide it by the prime numbers less than its square root and see if any of them divide it evenly.
If none of them do, then the number is likely prime (although there are some rare cases where this method can produce false negatives).
There are also more advanced algorithms for determining the primality of a number, such as the Miller-Rabin primality test.

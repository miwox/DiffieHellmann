Bob had to grin. Alice had told him the necessary prime and generator, now he just had to find her public key. But where could the public key of Alice be hidden?

Let's calculate Bobs public key first.
The formula looks like this:
Your secret must be smaller than $COMMON_PRIME_2
<formuar></formuar>
<script>
let latex = window.document.querySelector("formuar");
latex.innerText = "\\(Bobs \\: Public \\: Key \\: is \\: Y_{Bob} =\\:" + $COMMON_GEN_2 + "^{" + "Bobs \\: Secret" + "}\\: \\: modulo \\: \\: " + $COMMON_PRIME_2 + "\\)";
</script>\

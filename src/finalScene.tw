His gun was on the table. He put it in pants and opened the door. His eyes enlarged in shock. A Hellsolider was at his door.")\

The Hellsolider had not expected the Resistance's most wanted criminal to answer the door, and Bob would not have expected a Hellsolider to be at his door.

After a closer look, Bob realized that one of the mailboxes was open and inside, of course, was another note. But now there was a sequence of characters again. Fuck you Alice, he said to himself.

<div class="storyteller">Now it's getting a bit technical, but don't be afraid! It's necesscary to become the hidden hero in the history of mankind.
The DHM protocal allows to create the same key between two parties without changing the key.
Also when someone is hearing the communication between the two parties this the third party cannot reproduce the key of the two parties.
That's the most dangerous weapon for you Alice & Bob, so be careful and listen to all the this stept carefully.

Step 1:

</div>
Okay our prime number is $COMMON_PRIME.
Continue..
(click-replace:"Continue..")[Step 2:
<div class="storyteller">
Okay perfect! You both chosed the wonderful $COMMON_PRIME as your common prime number. After that please choose together a number which is smaller than your prime number $COMMON_PRIME \
and also a primitive root of $COMMON_PRIME. \
What a primitive root is can you find out by yourself. But for now on it's not so important.
</div>
Okay our primitive root is $COMMON_GEN.
Continue..
(click-replace:"Continue..")[Step 3:
<div class="storyteller">

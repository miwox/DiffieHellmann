A world where a dove has to tell the hawk where to fly. In this world, the hawk can decide at any time about the life of the dove. This my children is only a parable. We will have a time when freedom is a commodity of the past.")\

Where is the bomb going to go if no one knows where the target is? Where are the soldiers supposed to march if they don't know where? Bob thought hard and said, So a target, is the most important weapon? The master laughed No Bob, communication is the most important. Orders, goals, weaknesses, strengths and cooperation. ")\

I'm going to teach you how to talk to each other safely starting today. Everything is based on mathematics. Prime numbers are the building blocks of all integers. Either an integer is itself a prime number or it is made up of primes. The number 12, for example, is the product of so-called prime factors, i.e. several prime numbers multiplied together: 2 times 2 times 3. A prime number is divisible only by 1 and by itself. <br><br>[[Are you Ready?|PrimeGame]]")\
